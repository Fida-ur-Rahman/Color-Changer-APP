#  Color Changer App

A simple and interactive **Color Changer Web App** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that dynamically updates the background color with user interaction. This project demonstrates core front-end development concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and real-time UI updates.

---

##  Features

*  Change background color with a single click
*  Random color generator
*  Fully responsive design
*  Instant visual updates using JavaScript
*  Beginner-friendly and easy-to-understand code

---

##  Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Structure of the application
* **CSS3** – Styling and layout
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – Logic and interactivity

##  How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/color-changer-app.git
   ```

2. **Open the project folder**

   ```bash
   cd color-changer-app
   ```

3. **Run the app**

   * Open `index.html` in your browser

No additional setup or dependencies required

## How It Works

The app uses JavaScript to:

* Generate a random color (HEX or RGB)
* Select the page background element using the DOM
* Apply the new color dynamically when the user clicks a button

This demonstrates how JavaScript can directly control webpage styles in real time.

##  Future Improvements

* Show the HEX/RGB color code on screen
* Add a **Copy Color Code** button
* Add smooth transition animations
* Save previously generated colors
* Add light/dark UI modes
